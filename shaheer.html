He belonged to a well-educated and affluent family and received his early education from prestigious institutions such as Aitchison College and later studied at Oxford University. Imran made his debut in international cricket in 1971 and soon became one of the finest all-rounders in the world. His leadership skills came to the forefront when he captained the Pakistan national cricket team to its first-ever World Cup victory in 1992. His charisma, discipline, and determination earned him a legendary status in the cricketing world.</p>

    <h3 id="heading3"><u>Transition into Philanthropy</u></h3>

    <p>After retiring from cricket, Imran Khan shifted his focus to social work and philanthropy. One of his most notable achievements was the establishment of the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital in 1994, named after his mother who died of cancer. It was the first hospital of its kind in Pakistan to provide free cancer treatment to those in need. He also founded Namal University to promote higher education in underdeveloped areas. These initiatives helped build his reputation as someone who genuinely cared about the welfare of the people.</p>

    <h3 id="heading3"><u>Entry into Politics</u></h3>

    <p>In 1996, Imran Khan entered politics by founding his own political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), which translates to “Pakistan Movement for Justice.” The early years of the party were challenging, with limited public support and political influence. However, Khan remained persistent, campaigning against corruption, injustice, and elitism in Pakistani politics. Over time, his message began to resonate with a broader audience, especially the youth and middle class, who saw him as a symbol of hope and change.</p>

During his time in office, he focused on reducing corruption, improving the economy, and promoting welfare programs. He also tried to improve Pakistan's image internationally.
